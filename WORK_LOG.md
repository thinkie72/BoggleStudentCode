| January 6 | 9:25-9:55am | After a lot of whiteboard brainstorming, Caden and I came up with a method that could use DFS to search the board iteratively. I've started by filling the initial hash table to hold the index of the letters. I'm still not sure how i'll deal with duplicates, but I'll probably do it at the end. |
