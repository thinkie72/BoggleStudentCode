| January 6 | 9:25-9:55am  |    After a lot of whiteboard brainstorming, Caden and I came up with a method that could use DFS to search the board iteratively. I've started by filling the initial hash table to hold the index of the letters. I'm still not sure how i'll deal with duplicates, but I'll probably do it at the end. |
| January 7 |   2:15-3pm   |                                        In this class. I thought a lot about my approach. I'm thinking about a method that begins at the first letter of the word I check, then running DFS from there. I inputted the pseudocode from the slides, but more work needs to be done before I finish this... |
| January 9 | 12:45-1:45pm | I finished this. Using the pseudocode from the slides, I completed Boggle. I edited the Trie class to return TrieNodes instead of if the node is a word so that i could check for nulls, and if the prefix was a word in dfs. I made sure to prevent duplicates when seeing if the prefix was valid too. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
